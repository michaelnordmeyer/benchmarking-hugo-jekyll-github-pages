# Benchmarking Hugo vs. Jekyll vs. Github Pages

This repository has several Hugo, Jekyll, and Github Pages blogs with all having the same minimal theme. The Jekyll and Github Pages blogs have both local and remote theme variants. The purpose is to benchmark build times.

I started this very basic benchmark to get an idea of how much faster [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) builds could be, because my local [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) setup with a remote theme took several seconds to build with a remote [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), and building my site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the traditional Github Pages gem took a minute. This was for about 120 posts and pages, an Atom and JSON feed, and a sitemap.xml.

While I realized that a remote theme will always be fetched while building, and, depending on the internet connection, a local theme can save some time, I wanted to find out what else there is.

## A Comment on Github Pages Gem's Current State

Judging from the number of [ignored issues](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/pulls) for the Github Pages gem, and the availability to use your [own Github Actions workflow to build a static site on Github for Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages), it is save to assume that the Github Pages gem is not relevant anymore, reached its end, and should be replaced with ordinary Jekyll builds.

## Methodology

I deliberately chose a very simple theme called <q>[Etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch)</q> for this test, to make sure, that differences in theme implementations are minimized and have no performance impact. As this theme is only available for Hugo, I [ported it to Jekyll](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/jekyll-theme-etch). The local variants are included in this repo.

What this cannot test is the behavior of these engines with much more complicated themes, but this will always need an individual test.

Benchmarking should be done with `time` to include the launch time of the engines, and not just relying on the reported build times. The average of ten runs seems right.

Note: Your shell might have a built-in `time` command. Make sure to use `/usr/bin/time`.

## Data Set

I used two post templates. One with just eight paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum, and one with all supported Markdown of Github-flavored Markdown.

The data sets are generated by `generate-posts.sh` and consist of:

- 100/1,000/10,000/100,000 posts
- 0 pages
- 0 images
- 2 static files (favicon.ico and robots.txt)
- 1 Atom feed
- 1 sitemap.xml

There are no tags nor categories, and no redirects.

There’s no Liquid or any Jekyll-specifics like internal linking or short codes included after the front matter.

## Hugo

[Hugo supports asset minification](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/minification/), which the [Etch theme uses](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/blob/master/layouts/partials/head.html#L12-L28). I patched this out manually, because Jekyll doesn't support minification without third-party plugins. The CSS is included statically and Etch's dark mode has been removed.

## Jekyll

The Github Pages plugin includes a bunch of other plugins, but they are not enabled in `_config.yml`.

To get feature parity with Hugo, additional plugins are `jekyll-feed` 0.15.1 for Github Pages and 0.17 for Jekyll, and `jekyll-sitemap` 1.4.0.

The theme files where included in the blog itself to avoid any remote theme fetching. Etch’s dark mode is not implemented, and SASS is not used as the theme doesn’t use it for Hugo.

## Results

Some results benchmarked on a MacBook Pro M1 Max can be found [here](https://michaelnordmeyer.com/benchmarking-hugo-vs-jekyll-vs-github-pages-in-2023), but you can and should use your own blog's content for a better comparison.
